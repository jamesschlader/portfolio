                <p>I’m transitioning from a 17 year career in retail, 13 of those years in Store Management. Most of my
                    career has been devoted to leading teams to over-perform to goals, grow in personal development,
                    and make valuable contributions to the community. <br><br>
                    It's a very exciting time to live. Many of the science fiction dreams of my childhood are becoming
                    the mundane reality of today. The best is yet to come, and I want to help build that future. From
                    artificial intelligence to quantum computing to blockchain to the internet of things, the newest
                    developments coming will make everyone’s lives better and allow everyone to focus on things that
                    truly matter to them.
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, I’m gaining the critical learning and experience necessary to start a career in
                    full-stack web development by enrolling in the University of Utah Full-Stack Development Program.
                    My goal is to use the extensive leadership experience I’ve accumulated in my retail life to lead
                    teams of developers to create the tech that will serve to improve the lives of millions of people
                    around the world.

                    Walgreens
                </h3>
                <h6>Store Manager</h6>
                <p>November 2005 until April 2018<br><br>
                    As a Walgreens Store Manager, I was responsible for the total operations of a Walgreens Drug Store,
                    including the pharmacy, with the assistance of the Pharmacy Manager. I've been Store Manager at
                    only two locations, the second of which was my home since July of 2007, 24-hour, with a high volume
                    pharmacy. Being in charge of total store operations involved hiring, firing, and all human resource
                    duties, planning workflow, planning merchanding from ordering to logistics through to scheduling
                    and deploying resources to "get it done".<br><br>
                    There are a number of accomplishments I am proud of during my time as a Store Manager. First, a
                    number of the employees I have hired or developed over the years have subsequently been promoted to
                    Store Manager themselves. Secondly, at the store I most recently managed, over the years we were
                    able to advance sales and profits to the point where we were among the top 3 Walgreens stores in
                    Utah in both sales and profit out of a total of 40+ stores. Most recently, a CVS location was built
                    literally across the street from our location. Not only did their presence not harm our sales or
                    customer base, they were forced out of 24-hour pharmacy status after only three month of opening.
                    Our prescription count increased subsequent to their arrival on our corner.

                    Walgreens
                </h3>
                <h6>Executive Store Manager</h6>
                <p>June 2003 until November 2005<br><br>
                    The Executive Assistant Manager position at Walgreens is the launching pad into Store Manager.
                    During my time as EXA, I worked at several locations and learned the trade in great detail. I
                    earned a Pharmacy Technician Certification Board certification as a pharmacy technician during this
                    time of my career. I also conducted my first applicant interviews, onboarded new employees, and
                    started learning the basics of human resources, scheduling, and employee development. <br><br>My
                    proudest achievement during this period of my career was to completely reset a store that had
                    gotten severely behind on its resets and revisions. Every department in the store required a reset
                    and there was no way I could do it all myself. It was a truly challenging team effort to guide the
                    team through the changes needed in order to find the time to execute the resets without losing
                    focus on customer service while simultaneously upskilling the team to not only learn the techniques
                    to execute the resets but also establish the habits to keep up with the reset schedule in the
                    future.

                <h6>Assistant Store Manager</h6>
                <p>December 2000 until June 2003<br><br>
                    Learned and excuted the daily basics of runnig a drug retail store operations. Duties included
                    customer service, including conflict and complaint resolution, inventory management, basic
                    supervision of small work teams, and some routine merchandising. During my time as an assistant
                    manager, it was very important for assistant managers to be able to move a great deal of
                    merchandise in short amounts of time. <br><br>My proudest accomplishment while as an assistant
                    manager was to completely resurrect a stockroom that had suffered from severe neglect prior to my
                    arrival. Although a great deal of labor was needed to make this happen, the most important part of
                    the accomplishment was in helping the team at the store see that it was possible to keep the
                    stockroom clean, work the overstock regularly, and keep product flowing.
