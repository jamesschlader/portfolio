            During my 17 year career in retail, I was devoted to leading teams
            to over-perform to goals, grow in personal development, and make
            valuable contributions to the community. <br /><br />
            I want to help build the sci-fi future of my childhood and make it
            accessible to everyone. From artificial intelligence to quantum
            computing to blockchain to the internet of things, the newest
            developments coming will make everyoneâ€™s lives better and allow
            people to focus on things that truly matter to them. <br /><br />

          <h3>Walgreens</h3>
          <h6>Store Manager</h6>
          <p>
            November 2005 until April 2018<br /><br />
            As a Walgreens Store Manager, I was responsible for the total
            operations of a Walgreens Drug Store. <br /><br />
            There are a number of accomplishments I am proud of during my time
            as a Store Manager. First, a number of the employees I hired or
            developed over the years were subsequently promoted to Store Manager
            themselves. Secondly, under my leadership, my most recent store
            advanced to among the top 3 Walgreens stores in Utah in both sales
            and profit out of a total of 40+ stores. Most recently, when a CVS
            location was built literally across the street from our location,
            not only did their presence not harm our sales or customer base,
            they were forced out of 24-hour pharmacy status only three months
            after opening. Our prescription count increased subsequent to their
            arrival on our corner.

        <div class="job job-2">
          <h3>Walgreens</h3>
          <h6>Executive Store Manager</h6>
          <p>
            June 2003 until November 2005<br /><br />
            During my time as an Executive Assistant Manager, I worked at
            several locations and learned the trade in great detail. I earned a
            PTCB certification as a pharmacy technician during this time of my
            career. I also conducted my first applicant interviews, onboarded
            new employees, and started learning the basics of human resources,
            scheduling, and employee development. <br /><br />My proudest
            achievement during this period of my career was that I could be
            relied upon to "rebuild" stores that had gotten behind on
            operational details. Beyond just doing the heavy lifting to clean
            these stores up, the primary achievement was in upskilling staff to
            keep up with operational demands.
